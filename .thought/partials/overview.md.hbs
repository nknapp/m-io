This package is a replacement for the functions of {{npm 'q-io'}} that I use in my projects. I have use `q-io/fs` a lot since it has functions
like `makeTree`, `listTree` and `removeTree`. Furthermore, its `read` and `write` function work with strings by default, which makes it easier to 
read text files.

Sadly, `q-io@1` depends on {{npm 'collections'}}@1, which 
[overwrites the function `Array.prototype.find` with an implementation that does not match the ES6-spec](https://github.com/montagejs/collections/issues/139).
This causes problems in {{npm 'jsdoc-parse'}}. This is another example of why [modifying objects you donâ€™t own][zakas dont modify]
is a bad practice.

This problem *could* be solved by using `q-io@2` instead of version 1. This version has [other problems](https://github.com/kriskowal/q-io/pull/155) which were
solved in version 1. It may be a silly feeling, but version 2 of `q-io` vseems not to receive too much care at the moment.

Since I do not use many functions, I have decided to write a drop-in replacement for my own purposes, and this is it: `m-io`.
If you like this and want to provide more methods for your needs, please go ahead and make a PR.
